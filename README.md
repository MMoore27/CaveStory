A remake of the 2004 indie game CaveStory in C++. Uses SDL library and compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio.

Following LimeOats tutorial "Remaking Cavestory in C++". His master repo can be found here: https://github.com/Limeoats/cavestory-development

Completed ten episodes of tutorial, placing project on hold indefinitely due to difficulty understanding later parts of the tutorial.

The latest commit is not working, see previous commit for "working" version of code.
